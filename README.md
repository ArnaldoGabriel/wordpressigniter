A WordPress plugin that integrates CodeIgniter

Instructions:

We'll assume that you already have a working WordPress blog.

1. If you don't already have CodeIgniter, learn what it is here: http://ellislab.com/codeigniter
and then install it on your web site.

2. Create a page, and give it a meaningful title.

3. Install this plugin to your WordPress instance on your web site.

4. Go to the WordPressIgniter(tm) settings, and set the Page Override to the title of the page you created in step #1.  It must match verbatim.

5. Set the CodeIgniter Path setting to point to the folder containing CodeIgniter's index.php front controller file.

6. Optionally, set your own custom APPPATH and BASEPATH constants to point to custom paths for the system and application folders, if you choose to put them in another place besides the CodeIgniter defaults.

TODO:

- provide a way to make CodeIgniter automatically use WordPress' database settings.
